## Post-Build Hardening (Codebase Gap Review) — detail for CR-004

| # | Issue | Fix | Test | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | No organizer-ownership check on participant registration, fixture generation, result submission (any organizer could manage any tournament) | Added `organizer_id` check in `participant_service.py`, `fixture_service.py`, `result_service.py` | `test_other_organizer_cannot_register_participants`, `test_other_organizer_cannot_generate_fixtures`, `test_other_organizer_cannot_submit_result` | ✅ |
| 2 | Match/result responses showed raw participant IDs, not names | `get_participant_display()` helper; `MatchSchema`, `MatchResultSchema` updated | `test_matches_include_participant_names` | ✅ |
| 3 | Participant list showed raw IDs, not names | `ParticipantSchema.name` added | `test_participant_list_includes_names` | ✅ |
| 4 | Standings only appeared after first result (registered-but-unplayed participants invisible) | `list_standings()` now backfills a zero Standing row for every registered participant | `test_standings_show_all_participants_before_any_results` | ✅ |
| 5 | No single-item GET for Player/Team | `GET /players/{id}`, `GET /teams/{id}` added | `test_guest_can_view_single_player_without_login`, `test_guest_can_view_single_team_without_login` + 404 cases | ✅ |
| 6 | No way to update a player's team or remove a participant before tournament start | `PUT /players/{id}/team`, `DELETE /tournaments/{id}/participants/{id}` | `test_player_team_update.py`, `test_participant_removal.py` (12 tests total) | ✅ |
| 7 | CORS wide open (`origins: "*"`) | `CORS_ORIGINS` env-driven allowlist | Manual verification | ✅ |
| 8 | Inconsistent score serialization (string vs number) | Standardized on plain floats across `MatchResultSchema`, `StandingSchema` | Covered by existing result/standings tests | ✅ |
| 9 | No explicit indexes on FK columns | `index=True` added to all FK columns across 8 models; migration `c49a02e1137e` | N/A (performance, not behavior) | ✅ |

## P1 — Polish (SRS §38, §39)

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Error-handling audit (all 6 route files) | No inconsistencies found — every route already followed consistent `{"error": "..."}` shape and correct status codes |
| Security checklist | `.env` never committed (verified via `git log`), no `__pycache__` tracked, no hardcoded credentials, `SECRET_KEY` fallback removed |

**Status:** ✅ Complete

## P2 — Integration Testing

Two full end-to-end scenarios run against the live dev server via the actual HTTP API (not the pytest test client), documented in `backend/scripts/`:

- **Scenario A** (`scripts/scenario_a.ps1`) — 5-player round-robin tournament, full lifecycle: registration → open-registration → participant registration → start → fixture generation (10 matches) → result submission → automatic standings computation → automatic completion → guest read access at every stage. **Result: fully correct**, standings math verified by hand.
- **Scenario B** (`scripts/scenario_b.ps1`) — 6-player knockout tournament (8-slot bracket, 2 byes): bye auto-completion, Round 1 → Round 2 → Final winner advancement, champion determination, automatic completion, no third-place match generated. **Result: fully correct.**

**Bugs found and fixed during integration testing** (none of these were caught by the
unit/route-level pytest suite as it stood at the time, since all of them only surface
when exercised through a real multi-step API flow with real data). The first is now
tracked formally under CR-004; the second under the CR-003 addendum in
`docs/change-log.md`:

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| `email_verification_tokens.user_id` and `password_reset_tokens.user_id` had no `ON DELETE CASCADE`, blocking manual user cleanup with a raw FK violation | Added `ondelete="CASCADE"` to both FKs; migration `eb030e9e4708` |
| `/auth/register` rate limit (5/minute) was too aggressive for realistic bulk player registration by an organizer | Raised to 20/minute; `/auth/login` unchanged at 5/minute |
| Auto-generated migration `downgrade()` for the cascade fix referenced an unnamed constraint (`None`), causing a `CompileError` if ever rolled back | Explicitly named both FK constraints in `upgrade()`/`downgrade()` |

**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Summary

All functional requirements (FR-01–FR-07) and all eight change requests (CR-001–CR-008)
are complete. **113 automated tests passing**, plus 2 manual end-to-end integration
scenarios verified against the live API. Known limitations (in-memory rate limiting,
unscheduled blocklist purging, dev-only token exposure, non-historical team-roster
achievement attribution) are documented in `docs/SRS.md` §1.3 and §13 rather than
treated as open defects.

## Remaining before final submission

- **Diagrams (§17):** `docs/SRS.md` now references `docs/diagrams/context-diagram.svg`,
  `docs/diagrams/er-diagram.svg`, and related sequence/activity diagrams as the
  canonical source, but no `docs/diagrams/` directory exists in the repository yet —
  this is the one item in the SRS that is currently aspirational rather than reflecting
  the actual repo state. Schema and service interactions are fully finalized, so
  nothing blocks drawing these.
- **Frontend integration (P3):** ✅ Done since this matrix was last updated — a full
  React (Vite) frontend now exists under `frontend/src/`, covering guest browsing,
  player/organizer auth, tournament management, participant registration, fixture and
  standings display, and match result entry (23 pages, 6 API modules, shared
  `AuthContext`). Not yet broken out into its own FR-tracked rows in this matrix.
